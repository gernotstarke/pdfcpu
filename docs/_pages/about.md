# About `pdfcpu`

<img src="{{site-url}}/assets/logoSmall.png" width=200 align=right>

`pdfcpu` is a PDF processor written in Go supporting encryption.

## Use the Command Line Interface

Use shell scripts and the CLI to build your PDF processing pipelines for batch processing. `pdfcpu's` rich command line also allows the processing of encrypted files. You can use `pdfcpu` to manipulate your PDF files on the command line of all major platforms.  

## Use as Library
Use the `pdfcpu` API to integrate PDF processing into your Go based backend systems.

Each operation is available file based (also used by pdfcpu's CLI):
```
func OptimizeFile(inFile, outFile string, conf *pdf.Configuration) (err error)
```

and interface based (typically using io.ReadSeeker/io.Writer):
```
func Optimize(rs io.ReadSeeker, w io.Writer, conf *pdf.Configuration) error
```

Learn more about the API including examples for all operations at [GoDoc](https://godoc.org/github.com/pdfcpu/pdfcpu/pkg/api).
